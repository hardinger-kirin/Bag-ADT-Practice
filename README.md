# Bag-ADT-Practice

I made this project in my free time after briefly learning about the bag abstract data type (ADT) in my Data Structures class. 

I found an assignment online that goes as follows: a user has a bag full of items after leaving a grocery store. However, the user does not want fragile items such as bread or eggs to be included with other items. This program searches through the store bag to find fragile items, moving the fragile items to a designated bag, and the rest of the items to another bag.

Beyond adding and removing items, a bag must also have functionalities to return how many items are present, whether or not the bag is empty, clearing the bag of all items, returning how many times a particular item is present, and converting the bag's contents into a vector.
